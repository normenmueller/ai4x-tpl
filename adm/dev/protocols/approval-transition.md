# Approval Transition Protocol

Trigger example:
`Please apply the approval-transition protocol for <artifact>.`

## Purpose

Control planning-state transitions and prevent silent roadmap or task drift.

## Scope

This protocol governs transitions involving:

- `adm/pln/assessed/`
- `adm/pln/accepted/`
- `adm/pln/rejected/`
- `adm/pln/realized/`
- `adm/pln/rdmp.md`

## Rules

1. No transition into `accepted/` without explicit approval.
2. No roadmap change without explicit approval.
3. Rejection and realization must be explicit target states, not silent deletion.
4. Status and folder semantics must align.
5. `dateModified` must be updated for changed planning artifacts outside `inbox/`.
6. Every future transition from `adm/pln/assessed/` to `adm/pln/accepted/` must add a `## Plan` section to the accepted task.
7. The `## Plan` section must contain exactly one fenced text block with one directly copy-pasteable `/plan ` prompt.
8. The `/plan` prompt must be derived from the assessed proposal content, especially the intended target state, in-scope work, affected modules or interfaces, and acceptance or verification expectations.
9. The `/plan` prompt must stay short, direct, and execution-preparatory; approval prose, prioritization prose, and low-value narrative repetition are forbidden in that prompt.

## Mandatory Checks

- folder/status alignment
- roadmap slot/status consistency
- existence of decision proposal before transition
- explicit approval trace for accepted or roadmap changes
- for future `assessed -> accepted` transitions:
  - accepted artifact includes `# Content`
  - accepted artifact includes `## Plan`
  - `## Plan` contains one fenced text block
  - the fenced text block contains one directly copy-pasteable `/plan ...` prompt

## Completion Rule

A transition is valid only when folder, status, roadmap slot, and approval evidence all align.
For future `assessed -> accepted` transitions, the accepted task is additionally invalid unless the required `## Plan` section and copy-pasteable `/plan ...` prompt are present.
